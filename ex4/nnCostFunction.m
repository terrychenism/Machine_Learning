%NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
%neural network which performs classification
%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%

% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2, the weight matrices
% for our 2 layer neural network
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m

a1 = [ones(m,1) X]; %5000*401
z2 = a1 * Theta1';  %5000*25
a2 = [ones(size(z2,1),1)  sigmoid(z2)]; %5000*(25+1)
z3 = a2 * Theta2'; %5000*10
a3 = sigmoid(z3);
h=a3;

%%for循环版
J=0;
for k = 1:num_labels
	y1 = (y==k);
	J = J + 1/m* sum( -y1.*log(h(:,k)) - (1-y1).*log(1-h(:,k)) );
end

%%完全向量化版
J=0;
Y=zeros(m,num_labels);
for i=1:num_labels
	Y(:,i)=(y==i);
end
J = 1/m*sum(sum(-Y.*log(h)-(1-Y).*log(1-h)));

%%正则化后
J = J + lambda/2/m*( sum(sum(Theta1(:,2:end).^2)) + sum(sum(Theta2(:,2:end).^2)) );


% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.


delta3 = a3 - Y;
delta2 = delta3 * Theta2 .* [ones(size(z2,1),1) sigmoidGradient(z2)]; %5000*26

Delta1 = delta2(:,2:end)' * a1;  %25*401
Delta2 = delta3' * a2; %10*26

Theta1_grad = 1/m*Delta1;
Theta2_grad = 1/m*Delta2;

% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.
